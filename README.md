README for Blog Management Platform

Project Overview
This project involves developing a Blog Management Platform that enables users to create, manage, update, and delete blog posts. The platform includes user authentication, authorization, and image uploading functionalities, utilizing a technology stack that includes Node.js, Express.js, and PostgreSQL/MongoDB.

Objectives
The main goals of this project are:

User Authentication and Authorization: Implement secure user registration and login using JSON Web Tokens (JWT) to ensure only authenticated users can manage their posts.
Post CRUD Operations: Create robust API endpoints for handling create, read, update, and delete operations on blog posts.
Image Uploading: Enable users to upload images for their posts and link them securely to the respective entries in the database.
Database Integration: Use MongoDB for storing user information, blog posts, and images.
Requirements

1. User Authentication and Authorization
Implement user registration and login endpoints.
Utilize JWT for user authentication.
Ensure only authenticated users can create, update, or delete their own posts.
Implement middleware for route protection to verify user access.

3. Post CRUD Operations
Design API endpoints for the following actions:
Create a post: Accept title, content, and an optional image.
Read posts: Retrieve all posts or a single post by ID.
Update a post: Allow users to update their own posts.
Delete a post: Allow users to delete their own posts.
Implement data validation to ensure correct formatting and integrity.

4. Image Uploading
Enable image uploading using a suitable method (e.g., Multer for Node.js).
Ensure uploaded images are stored securely.
Link the image path to the respective post entry in the database.

5. Database Integration
Use either PostgreSQL or MongoDB for data storage.
Design database schemas for:
User: Store user credentials and details.
Post: Store post details, including the image reference.

Technology Stack
Backend: MongoDB
Authentication: JSON Web Tokens (JWT)
Image Uploading: Multer or a similar library
